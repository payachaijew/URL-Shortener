How It Works

1. User Input: User enters a long URL in the input field
2. Validation: URL is validated and normalized (adds https:// if missing)
3. Short Code Generation: A unique 6-character alphanumeric code is generated
4. Caching Check: System checks if URL already has a short code to avoid duplicates
5. Storage: Short code and URL mapping are stored in browser's localStorage
6. Display: Shortened URL is displayed with copy functionality
7. History: URL is added to history with timestamp and click tracking
8. Redirect: When someone visits the short URL, they're redirected to the original
